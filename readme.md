# SNAKE GAME

This is a simple snake game I made, and I am now turning it into a project! Right now, there is only a minimal snake game, but I will keep working on it!

## Instalation
Do not download the source code, because you have to setup python. Instead download the `Snek.exe` which is an executable instead of a python file. Both work, but the Executable is reccomended.
